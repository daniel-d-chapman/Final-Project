# Final-Project

My final project will feature a quiz about Melbourne city. It will be an interactive website with questions and multiple choice answers. I will initially look at building it for desktop, but will aim to include some responsive design for mobile too if I can.

I am considering expanding upon my original existing idea have a 'Welcome to Melbourne' Landing page. The Landing page could contain links to 'places of interest', 'top attractions' and a link to the quiz.
